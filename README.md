# Workflow CA

Welcome to the Workflow project at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media - Front End Development!
This project is dedicated to enhancing the quality of an existing social app by implementing superior development workflows and establishing a robust testing strategy.

## Configuration

### Prettier

Prettier is a powerful tool that automatically formats your code, ensuring consistent styling and saving valuable time on manual formatting. By enhancing code readability throughout the development process, Prettier promotes a cohesive and professional codebase.

### ESlint

ESLint serves as a guardian of coding standards, catching potential errors early and maintaining code quality. By enforcing consistent practices and identifying common pitfalls, ESLint fosters collaboration and ensures the integrity of your JavaScript code.

### Husky

Husky is your ally in automating pre-commit hooks, safeguarding code quality checks, and preventing commits that deviate from established standards. By seamlessly integrating with your workflow, Husky promotes adherence to best practices and maintains a high level of code quality.

### Jest

Implementing unit tests with Jest in this project guarantees the reliability and correctness of individual code units, including essential functions like login and logout. By facilitating early bug detection and promoting robust software development practices, Jest ensures the stability and resilience of your application.

### Cypress

Cypress takes center stage for end-to-end testing, validating the entire application workflow, including critical processes like login and logout. By providing a comprehensive view of your application's functionality and user experience, Cypress instills confidence in the integrity and performance of your application.
